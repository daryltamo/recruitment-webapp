## Components

### 1. Client
The client is the front-end of the application, built using EJS templates and served by the Express.js server. It interacts with the server through RESTful APIs.

### 2. Server
The server is built using Node.js and Express.js. It handles incoming requests, processes them, and sends responses back to the client. The server is structured into several layers:

- **Routes**: Define the endpoints for the application. Each route corresponds to a specific resource or functionality.
- **Controllers**: Handle the business logic for each route. They interact with models to retrieve or manipulate data.
- **Models**: Define the data structure and interact with the database. Each model corresponds to a specific entity in the application.

### 3. Database
The application uses PostgreSQL as the database management system. It stores all the application data, including user information, job applications, and organizational details.

### 4. Middleware
Middleware functions are used to handle requests and responses. They can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling.

### 5. Services
Service layer contains reusable business logic that can be shared across different parts of the application. This helps in maintaining a clean separation of concerns.

### 6. Utilities
Utility functions provide common functionalities that can be used throughout the application, such as data formatting and validation.

## Deployment
The application is containerized using Docker, allowing for easy deployment and scalability. The deployment process involves:

1. Building the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
2. Running the application using Docker Compose, which sets up the necessary services, including the web server and database.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a scalable and maintainable structure for the recruitment web application. It leverages modern technologies and best practices to ensure a robust and efficient system.
